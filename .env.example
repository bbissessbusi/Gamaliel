# Gamaliel — Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual keys.
# For production: add these same keys to Vercel Environment Variables.
#
# IMPORTANT: Use `vercel dev` (not `vite dev`) for local development
# so the /api/ edge functions are available.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC: Visit /api/health in your browser to test all connections.
# It will tell you exactly which services are working and which are not.
#
# COMMON ISSUES:
# - "invalid x-api-key" → The key has extra quotes or invisible chars.
#   Re-copy it from https://console.anthropic.com/api-keys and paste
#   it clean (no quotes) into Vercel Settings → Environment Variables.
# - "Network error during upload" → Supabase project may be paused.
#   Go to supabase.com/dashboard → click "Restore" on your project.
