      <h1>Gamaliel — AI Sermon Coach and Homiletics Scorecard</h1>
      <p>Gamaliel is a free AI-powered preaching improvement tool built for pastors, preachers, ministers, and Bible teachers. Upload your sermon recording (audio or video) and Gamaliel will transcribe it and provide a detailed homiletics scorecard with scores and personalized coaching.</p>
      <h2>How Gamaliel Helps Preachers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload any sermon recording — audio or video, up to 60 minutes</li>
        <li>AI transcription powered by Deepgram converts your sermon to text</li>
        <li>Gamaliel AI (powered by Claude) analyzes your sermon across 12 criteria</li>
        <li>Get a homiletics scorecard covering theological fidelity, exegetical soundness, gospel centrality, relevancy, clarity, connectivity, precision, call to action, relatability, pacing, enthusiasm, and charisma</li>
        <li>Receive a personalized anchoring point (your strongest moment), structural drift (where you lost focus), and a measurable improvement step</li>
        <li>Track your preaching progress over time with saved evaluations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Who Is Gamaliel For?</h2>
      <p>Gamaliel is designed for anyone who preaches or teaches the Bible: senior pastors, associate pastors, youth pastors, lay preachers, guest speakers, seminary students studying homiletics, Bible study leaders, and church planters. Whether you preach weekly or occasionally, Gamaliel helps you sharpen your sermon delivery, structure, and theological accuracy.</p>
      <h2>What Makes Gamaliel Different</h2>
      <p>Unlike generic AI tools, Gamaliel is purpose-built for homiletics. It understands theological fidelity, exegetical soundness, and gospel centrality — not just grammar and delivery. It scores your sermon across three pillars: Sacred Foundation (pass/fail doctrinal checks), Structural Weight (relevancy, clarity, connectivity, precision, call to action scored 0-10), and Vocal Cadence (relatability, pacing, enthusiasm, charisma scored 0-10). Every evaluation ends with a specific, actionable coaching step you can practice before your next sermon.</p>
      <h2>About the Name</h2>
      <p>Gamaliel is named after the respected Jewish teacher mentioned in Acts 5:34 of the Bible — a wise and honored teacher of the law. Just as Gamaliel was known for his wisdom and measured counsel, this tool provides thoughtful, constructive feedback to help preachers grow in their craft.</p>
